Curiosity Rover: The Curiosity Rover, also known as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), is a car-sized rover that was launched by NASA in 2011 and landed on Mars in 2012. It is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program and is designed to explore the Martian surface and assess the planet's habitability. Curiosity is equipped with various scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and drills, allowing it to analyze rocks, soil, and the atmosphere. It has made significant discoveries, such as finding evidence of ancient water and identifying organic molecules on Mars.

Opportunity Rover: The Opportunity Rover was a robotic rover that was part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover mission. It landed on Mars in 2004 and operated until 2018. Opportunity's primary objective was to study the Martian surface and search for signs of past water activity. It provided valuable data about the geological history of Mars and discovered evidence of ancient water flows and environments suitable for microbial life. Despite facing challenges such as dust storms and aging hardware, Opportunity operated far beyond its expected mission duration and became one of NASA's longest-serving Mars rovers.

Spirit Rover: The Spirit Rover was a robotic rover launched by NASA in 2003 as part of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. It landed on Mars in the same year and operated until 2010. Spirit's main objective was to study the geology and climate of Mars and search for signs of past water activity. It successfully provided evidence of ancient hot springs and volcanic activity on the Martian surface. Spirit faced challenges during its mission, such as getting stuck in soft soil, but continued to operate as a stationary science platform until contact was lost in 2010.
